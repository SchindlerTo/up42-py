Our website uses Bing Ads, a service of Microsoft Corporation, One Microsoft Way, Redmond, WA 98052-6399, USA (\u201cMicrosoft\u201d). Microsoft uses cookies and similar technologies to present you with advertisements which you may find relevant. The use of these technologies enables Microsoft and its partner websites to insert advertisements on the basis of previous visits to our or other websites on the internet. e. LinkedIn. We use the LinkedIn conversion tracking retargeting tool for marketing purposes, provided by LinkedIn Ireland, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland (\u201cLinkedIn\u201d). A LinkedIn Insight Tag is integrated into our website, which enables LinkedIn to collect pseudonymous data about your visit and the use of our website and to provide us with corresponding aggregated statistics on this basis. In addition, this information is used to show you interest-based and relevant offers and recommendations after you have shown an interest in certain information and e.g. job vacancies on our website. This information is assigned via a cookie. You can prevent the storage of cookies by adjusting your browser settings. Alternatively, you can object to this form of data processing by using the following link to place an opt-out cookie, which will remain on your device until you delete the cookie. This option is available to both LinkedIn members and non-members. For further information, please refer to the LinkedIn privacy policy . f. Facebook conversion and retargeting tags. For marketing purposes our website uses what are known as conversion and retargeting tags (also called Facebook Pixels) from the social network Facebook, a service of Facebook, Inc., 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, California 94025, USA (\u201cFacebook\u201d). We use Facebook Pixels to analyze the general use of our website and to track the effectiveness of Facebook advertising (\u201cconversion\u201d). We may also use Facebook Pixels to show you individualized advertising messages based on your interest in our website and our services (\u201cretargeting\u201d). For this purpose, Facebook processes data that the service collects via cookies and similar technologies on our website. Facebook may transfer the data generated in this context to a server in the USA for evaluation and store it there. In exceptional cases where this involves transferring personal data to the USA, Facebook has also subjected itself to the EU-US Privacy Shield . Facebook has thus committed itself to ensuring the European data protection principles and level of data protection even in the context of data processing performed in the USA. If you are member of Facebook and have given Facebook the relevant permission in your account\u2019s privacy settings, Facebook may also link the information recorded about your visit to us to your member account and use it to deploy targeted Facebook ads. You can view and change the privacy settings of your Facebook profile at any time. If you are not a member of Facebook, you can prevent Facebook from processing your data by clicking on the deactivation button for the provider \u201cFacebook\u201d on the external TrustArc opt-out website. Alternatively, you can disable the Facebook Pixel on the Digital Advertising Alliance page at the following Link: here . If you disable data processing by Facebook, Facebook will only display general Facebook ads that are not selected based on information recorded about you. Please refer to Facebook\u2019s data policy for further details. g. Twitter Ads. On our website we use services of the short message service Twitter, Twitter International Company, One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street Dublin 2, D02 AX07 Ireland (\u201cTwitter\u201d). Twitter enables us to use visitor interaction pixels to deploy target group-based advertising, retargeting and conversion measurements for online advertising. This involves deploying offers for certain target groups based on a selection of general criteria, e.g. demographic characteristics, regions or interests. Twitter also allows us to display targeted ads based on a user\u2019s previous page views. For example, ads about our services can be shown to the respective user if that user has previously been interested in certain information or offers on our website. Twitter is certified under the EU-US Privacy Shield and is thus committed to complying with European data protection regulations. You can prevent this data processing by disabling the storage of cookies in your browser by adjusting the settings as described above. If you are a Twitter user, you can also prevent the aforementioned data processing in your Twitter account by adjusting the \u201cPersonalized ads\u201d setting in the \u201cPersonalization and Data\u201d area. On mobile devices, the aforementioned data processing can also be prevented using the system settings \u201cLimit Ad Tracking\u201d (iOS) or \u201cInterest-based ads\u201d (Android). For further information, please refer to the Twitter website . h. Google Tag Manager. Our website uses Google Tag Manager, a service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland (\"Google\"). Google Tag Manager serves to manage tools for usage data analyses and other services, so-called website tags. A tag is an element that is stored in the source code of our website in order to record, for example, predefined uses and interactions. Google Tag Manager does not use cookies. Google Tag Manager enables us to integrate partners in the context of online advertising. If you opted-out of the processing for the other tools and third-party services described in this section, no data will be processed by Google Tag Manager. In some cases, the data is processed on a Google server in the USA. In exceptional cases where this involves transferring personal data to the USA, Google has also subjected itself to the EU-US Privacy Shield . Google has thus committed itself to ensuring the European data protection principles and level of data protection even in the context of data processing performed in the USA. For more details, please refer to the information provided by Google about Google Tag Manager . 3.4. Commercial E-Mails.

It also diminishes built-up area features that are often correlated with open water in other indices.

This means, Apply a deterministic decision boundary / threshold to NDWI values Translate the threshold values into boolean value mask (1/0) Convert raster into vector boundary (multipolygon) According the NDWI-wikipedia : For the second variant of the NDWI, another threshold can also be found in that avoids creating false alarms in urban areas: < 0.3 - Non-water >= 0.3 - Water Meaning all the values that are >= 0.3 will be mapped to value true and < 0.3 to false respectively.

At UP42, we recently developed an OpenStreetMap Data Block which is available on our marketplace. As hinted before, the coordinate system of Sentinel-2 data is in EPSG:3857 and the OSM query is done in EPSG:4326 . Therefore, we'll need to perform some coordinate transformation here for both the OSM data retrieval as well as plotting the results with Folium. Let's define the transform. In [23]: # transform crs crs_project = partial ( pyproj . transform , pyproj . Proj ( init = 'epsg:3857' ), # source coordinate system pyproj . Proj ( init = 'epsg:4326' ) # destination coordinate system ) In [24]: # read bounds from dataset and transform to wgs84 osm_poly = transform ( crs_project , box ( * src_bounds )) In the next part, we will create a new workflow within the scope of same project that we initialized and authenticated in earlier part.

This is the first of a series of jupyter notebooks where example SAR workflows will be explained that can be run on UP42. All of the examples are based on a specific type of analysis which is called polarimetry and processes one image at a time. In comparison to polarimetric there also is interferometric analysis which leverages the information encoded in suitable pairs of radar image. In this notebook we want to have a look at the Sentinel-1 GRD full scene block, followed by SNAP Sentinel-1 Polarimetric Processing. Polarimetric SAR Processing turns a Sentinel-1 GRD image into a multichannel GeoTIFF that is ready for analysis.

This is the first of a series of jupyter notebooks where example SAR workflows will be explained that can be run on UP42. All of the examples are based on a specific type of analysis which is called polarimetry and processes one image at a time. In comparison to polarimetric there also is interferometric analysis which leverages the information encoded in suitable pairs of radar image. In this notebook we want to have a look at the Sentinel-1 GRD full scene block, followed by SNAP Sentinel-1 Polarimetric Processing.
